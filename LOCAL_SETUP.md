## Troubleshooting

**Port Already in Use:**
If port 5000 is already in use, the application will automatically try the next available port.

**Email Not Working:**
Email functionality requires proper Gmail credentials in the `.env` file. The website will work without email setup, but contact form submissions won't send emails.

**Build Issues:**
Make sure you're using Node.js version 18 or higher:
```bash
node --version
```

## Deployment

For production deployment, you can use platforms like:
- Vercel
- Netlify
- Railway
- Heroku

Build the project first:
```bash
npm run build
```

## Support

If you encounter any issues during setup, please check:
1. Node.js version compatibility
2. All dependencies are installed
3. Environment variables are set correctly (if using email features)

Enjoy your new portfolio website! ðŸš€
